## Accessibility Support and Best Practices with HTML Semantics

-   The project is built with strong accessibility support for both PC and mobile devices.

## üë©üèΩ‚Äçüç≥ The Process

1. **Initial Setup**:

    - Created `index.html` and `styles.css` files.
    - Developed a hard-coded UI for the project.

2. **Adding Functionality**:
    - Organized all assets, such as CSS, images, and scripts, in the `/assets` folder.
    - Implemented the `#Header Scroll State` in `app.js` (located at `/assets/js/app.js`) to manage the header's active state.
    - Added the `#Search Toggle` functionality to manage the search state.
    - Implemented `#Tab Navigation & Keyboard Accessibility for Tab Buttons` to enable state changes in tab navigation and allow navigation using keyboard arrow keys.
    - Integrated the `GitHub API` to fetch data and populate the hard-coded UI dynamically.

## üìö What I Learned

-   Effective use of HTML semantics
-   Writing DRY and clean code
-   Improving accessibility
